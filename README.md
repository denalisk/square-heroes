## About
### Description
Square Hero is a basic hack and slash adventure game made in a few days by the above folks. Kill enemies! Get drops! Level up! What more can you ask for, apart from some real graphics? It's part of a group project assignment at Epicodus Code School in Seattle, WA.

### Controls
* WASD or Arrow Keys (Movement)
* Spacebar (Attack)

### Live Demo
**PLACEHOLDER**

### Known Bugs
* There is an item, we don't know which, that crashes the game. We aren't even sure it does it anymore, but we didn't actively find it, so it's potentially still there.
* Enemy respawns are sometimes way out of range. (At least bosses should be consistent)

### Icebox
* Add additional attributes to character (str, dex, spells, feats, etc) to track
* Create level-up check on experience modification
* Multiplayer

### Technology
* Typescript
* Angular
